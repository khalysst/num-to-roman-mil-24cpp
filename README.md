# C++ Conversion of Numbers to Roman and Military to 24 Hours

<p>
This was one of my first laboratory activities, so do note the code inconsistencies. </br>
This C++ program runs on user input. For the conversion of numbers to roman numerals, it will ask for numbers ranging from 1 to 3000. </br>
On the other hand, for the conversion of military to 24 hours, it will only permit military style numbers. </br>

<b> You'll need an appropriate platform to run C++ in order for the program to work. This was programmed in Dev C++ </b> </p>
